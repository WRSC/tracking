# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# And bundled dependencies
/vendor/bundle/

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
*.sqlite3
seeds.rb
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
#ignore all the internal files made by gedit
*.*~
# And swap files saved by vim
*.swp
