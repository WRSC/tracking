# Server development guide


## Get a linux server

You can use your own server or get a cheap VPS started from Digital Ocean started $5 per month. (referral code to be inserted here)

## Prepare rails app

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/WRSC/tracking.git

Install ruby 

Check this [instruction](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-16-04)


Install ruby packages

    gem install bundle
    cd MYR_rails
    bundle install


## Initialise the database and serve the website in development mode

    export RAIL_ENV=development
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails s 


## Update the database for a competition

To update the website for a new competition, both visual front-end and database back-end need to be changed.

- Most front-end related files are under `/MYR_rails/app/views` folder. 
- Database file is under `/MYR_rails/db` folder.

    - Depends on the mode, you'll see one (development, production, test) of SQLite database there. You do need to configure them manually
    - Edit the seed file under `seeds` folder, the `seeds2018` is self-explanatory. After that run `bundle exec rake db:seed:seeds2018` to add admin users and missions to the competition.


## Run the server in production environment

### Repeat the initialise the database and update the database step in production mode

    cd MYR_rails # Assume you are under /tracking/MYR_rails folder
    export RAIL_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:seed:seeds2018 # Replace when necessary




### Run in CLI or create a bash script

    #!/bin/bash
    export RAIL_ENV=production
    export SECRET_KEY=... # Fill in a SECRET_KEY key, 'rake secret' can generate one

    cd tracking/MYR_rails
    bundle exec s -e production -b 0.0.0.0 -p 80
